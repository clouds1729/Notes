\section{Daily Bible Verses}

\subsection{\protect\bigskip May 9, 2024}

\textbf{Mark 9:35}

$35$ And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man
desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all. 

\begin{remark}
Jesus wanted to rectify the distorted concept of being great that his
disciples had in their mind and teach them the values of the kingdom of God
by saying, \textquotedblleft Anyone who wants to be first must be the very
last, and the servant of all.\textquotedblright\ In the kingdom of God, the
greatest are those who are the very last and the servant of all. It requires
a radical change of our value system to accept this teaching of Jesus.
Therefore, if we want to be great in the kingdom of God, we must discard our
worldly concept of greatness, and keep the kindgom concept in our mind and
practice it in our daily lives.
\end{remark}
